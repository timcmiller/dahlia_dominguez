        Hi -- I'm Dahlia and I'm a graphic artist.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am currently an undergraduate at UC San Diego where I am studying Interdisciplinary Computing and Art with a minor in General Biology. My schooling along with other experiences within graphic design have led me to a great appreciation of design, layout, balance, and visual aesthetics.
        <br />
        <br />
        My interests lie in visual spacialization and the use of visual aids to promote information and data. I hope to pursue this interest even more in the future.
        <br />
        <br />
        But for now, please take a look at my portfolio. A collection of past works, my portfolio demonstrates a combination of pieces produced for school, for work, and for fun.
